Create a Navbar where you have three options Home, Login, Signup on RHS. This navbar page should be visible in all the three pages you will be building i.e index.html, Login.html, and Signup.html.

In signup.html, a user should be able to signup with details like ‘name, contact no, email, password’. The form should not be submitted if any of the fields are empty. store the user signup data in local storage.

In login.html, the user should be able to log in using ‘email and password’ If wrong username/password, alert ‘invalid Credentials’.

If login successful, send the user to index.html .

index.html should have a navbar like all other pages ( signup and login pages ).
